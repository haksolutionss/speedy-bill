Here are the 4 issues that need to be fixed:

1. KOT & Bill Number Format:
- KOT number always shows "1" instead of incrementing
- Both KOT and Bill numbers show random IDs like "ebb9737f" or "b2c85889"
- Fix: Use auto-incrementing format like "01" (this KOT will be reset each day so can u store the data in localStorage of previous printed KOT) and "BILL-0001" (and this need to understand correclyy)

2. Cart Item Missing After Table Switch:
- Added 2 products to cart and printed KOT
- After switching tables, the last added item disappears from cart (but KOT was printed)
- Fix: Ensure all cart items persist after printing and table switching

3. Product Portion & Pricing:
- Check if product has portions in `product_portion` table
- If yes, show portion options and get portion-specific price
- Use location-based pricing if available, otherwise use default price
- Fix: Implement proper portion selection with correct pricing logic

4. GST & Currency Display:
- When GST is set to "none" in tax settings, still showing GST calculations
- Fix: Hide all GST calculations when tax is "none" and aslo don't calculate gst anywhere,
