### Requested Enhancements (Permission-Based)

Please integrate the following functionalities with strict role/permission-based access control:

1. Clear All History (Admin Only)

   * Provide an option to completely purge all billing history.
   * This should:

     * Delete all bill records and all related tables (bill items, payments, logs, etc.).
     * Reset the `bill_number` sequence back to 1.
   * Must include:

     * Confirmation dialog (irreversible action warning).
     * Proper transaction handling to avoid partial deletes.
     * Audit logging of who performed the action and when.

2. Product & Category CSV Import / Export

   * Implement CSV import and export for Products and Categories.
   * Import requirements:

     * Strong validations (mandatory fields, data types, duplicates, invalid references).
     * Clear, user-friendly error messages with row-level error reporting.
     * Batch-wise upload processing to handle large files efficiently.
     * Loaders and progress indicators during upload and processing.
     * Rollback or safe handling for failed batches.
   * Export requirements:

     * Export data in a clean, well-structured CSV format.
     * Respect user permissions (only allowed data should be exported).

3. Sorting & Pagination Across Modules

   * Add server-side sorting and pagination for all major data-heavy modules, especially:

     * Products
     * Billing History
     * Any other list-based modules with large datasets
   * Features should include:

     * Sort by commonly used fields (name, date, price, bill number, etc.).
     * Configurable page size.
     * Optimized queries to ensure good performance on large datasets.
